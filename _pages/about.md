My name is Brian Hughes, I am a senior at UMBC graduating in spring majoring in environmental science.

In addition to my major I am obtaining the GIScience certificate and the entrepreneurship minor.

GIS has been my primary focus in my area of study and my technical proficiency is one of my strongest assets.

I have experience in ENVI, arcGIS Pro/Online, QGIS, R, autoCAD, Adobe Illustrator, among a few other programs.

I am always willing to learn and take my skills to the next level!
