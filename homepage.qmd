I'm Brian, a senior at UMBC graduating this spring.\
\
My primary focus in my studies has been geographic information systems.

I have skills in a wide variety of computer programs and my technical proficiency is one of my strongest assets. I have worked with ENVI, arcGIS Pro/Online, QGIS, autoCAD, R, Adobe Illustrator and a few others.
